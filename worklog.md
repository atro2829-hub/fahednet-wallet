Work Log:
- Read worklog.md to review previous task history and context
- Checked keystore file existence: Found at `/home/z/my-project/south-wallet.keystore` (project root); not found at android/, android/app/, or android/app/keystore/ subdirectories
- Reviewed all 3 build.gradle files for signing configuration:
  - User app (android/app/build.gradle): namespace com.qtbm.south, supports CI properties via `-PMYAPP_UPLOAD_*`, local fallback to `../../south-wallet.keystore`
  - Admin app (south-admin/android/app/build.gradle): namespace com.qtbm.south.admin, same CI property pattern, local fallback to `../../../south-wallet.keystore`
  - Dev app (south-dev/android/app/build.gradle): namespace com.qtbm.south.dev, same CI property pattern, local fallback to `../../../south-wallet.keystore`, has try-catch for google-services.json

- All sounds generated with:
  - 22050 Hz sample rate, 16-bit PCM, Mono
  - Maximum amplitude 0.7 (avoid harshness)
  - Harmonics for rich but gentle timbre: [(1, 1.0), (2, 0.15-0.4), (3, 0.05-0.15)]
  - Exponential decay envelopes for natural bell/chime feel
  - Fade-in/fade-out to prevent clicks
